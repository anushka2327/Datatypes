# EXPERIMENT 2
# Datatypes
## Aim:
To study and implement c++ program structure (Data Types)
## Theory:
Fundamental data types in C++ define the basic types of data that can be manipulated by programs. They include:  
Integer Types:  
int: Typically represents a signed integer with a size that depends on the system architecture (commonly 4 bytes).  
short: Typically smaller than int (commonly 2 bytes).  
long: Larger than int (commonly 4 or 8 bytes).  
long long: Larger than long (commonly 8 bytes).  
Floating-Point Types:  
float: Single-precision floating-point type, typically occupies 4 bytes.  
double: Double-precision floating-point type, typically occupies 8 bytes.  
long double: Extended precision floating-point type, larger than double (size varies by implementation).  
Character Types:  
char: Typically represents a single byte (8 bits) that can hold one character from the ASCII character set.
